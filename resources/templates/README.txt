hey jon. here is a little rig for you to mess with the css
a more interesting example is the spotify one with song urls and stuff, but this is a good starting place.

to work on it, install babashka (for templating): https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation, and do npm install (for tailwind).

then in two terminals do ./run.sh, then ./css.sh

the templating language is https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer, which has fairly extensive documentation
